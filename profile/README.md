## Why we meet

Accessibility work can be tiring, especially if you’re the only one pushing for it! In this group, we support each other, share approaches, and learn from each other. We also share how we’re making our work more accessible, and how we’re upping our own skills at accessibility. We meet in person so that we can be open and honest, in a safe space.

Examples of topics and questions from previous meetings:

- How do I make PDFs and Microsoft Office documents more accessible?
- How do I build accessibility into my team’s daily practices?
- How do I convince stakeholders about the value of accessibility work?
- How does inaccessible content exclude people?
